# MapGenerator for Unity

A robust, customizable procedural maze generator for Unity that creates playable maze levels with collectibles, enemies, and interactive elements.

![Maze Generator Example](images/maze-example.png)

## üéÆ Features

- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Creates unique mazes every time using depth-first search algorithm
- **Customizable Terrain Sets**: Support for multiple theme sets with different visual styles
- **Dynamic Elements**:
  - Collectible items
  - Breakable walls (with smart placement to avoid L/T shapes)
  - Decorative elements
  - Enemy patrol paths (straight and L-shaped)
- **Player & Endpoint Spawning**: Automatic placement at start and finish positions
- **Unity-Ready**: Easy to integrate into any Unity project

## üìã Requirements

- **Unity Version**: Tested on Unity 2022.3+ (should work on 2019.4+ with minimal changes)
- **Required Components**:
  - StarterAssets package (for player controller - can be replaced with your own)
  - Basic understanding of Unity prefabs and component system
- **Scripts Required**:
  - Collectible.cs (simple MonoBehaviour for collectible items)
  - BreakableWall.cs (MonoBehaviour for walls that can be destroyed)
  - EnemyController.cs (Script for handling enemy movement)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Import Assets**:
   - Copy the MapGenerator.cs script into your project's Scripts folder
   - Create folders for your wall, floor, and decoration prefabs

2. **Prepare Required Scripts**:
   Create these required script components if you don't have them already (below are some basic examples):

   ```csharp
   // Collectible.cs - Simple script for collectible items
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class Collectible : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public int value = 1;
       
       private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)
       {
           if (other.CompareTag("Player"))
           {
               // Add to player score/inventory
               Debug.Log("Collected item!");
               Destroy(gameObject);
           }
       }
   }
   
   // BreakableWall.cs - Script for walls that can be broken
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class BreakableWall : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public float health = 100f;
       public GameObject breakEffect; // Optional particle effect
       
       public void Damage(float amount)
       {
           health -= amount;
           if (health <= 0)
           {
               if (breakEffect != null)
                   Instantiate(breakEffect, transform.position, Quaternion.identity);
               Destroy(gameObject);
           }
       }
   }
   
   // Basic EnemyController.cs - For enemy patrolling
   using UnityEngine;
   
   public class EnemyController : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public Transform[] patrolPoints;
       public float moveSpeed = 3f;
       public float waitTime = 1f;
       
       private int currentPointIndex = 0;
       private float waitCounter = 0f;
       private bool waiting = false;
       
       private void Update()
       {
           if (patrolPoints.Length == 0)
               return;
               
           if (waiting)
           {
               waitCounter += Time.deltaTime;
               if (waitCounter >= waitTime)
               {
                   waiting = false;
               }
           }
           else
           {
               Transform targetPoint = patrolPoints[currentPointIndex];
               Vector3 direction = targetPoint.position - transform.position;
               direction.y = 0; // Keep movement on the horizontal plane
               
               if (direction.magnitude < 0.1f)
               {
                   // Reached waypoint
                   waitCounter = 0f;
                   waiting = true;
                   currentPointIndex = (currentPointIndex + 1) % patrolPoints.Length;
               }
               else
               {
                   transform.position += direction.normalized * moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime;
                   transform.rotation = Quaternion.LookRotation(direction);
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Create a new GameObject** in your scene and name it "MazeGenerator"
2. **Add the MapGenerator script** to this GameObject
3. **Configure the inspector settings** according to your needs
4. **Create and assign prefabs** for walls, floors, decorations, and other elements
5. **Press Play** to generate and test your maze

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The MapGenerator comes with many customizable options in the Inspector:

### Maze Settings
- **Width & Height**: Size of the maze (in cells)
- **Cell Size**: Physical size of each cell (automatically calculated from wall prefabs)

### Terrain Assets
Create at least one TerrainAssets set including:
- **Floor Prefabs**: The ground tiles for each cell
- **Wall Prefabs**: Separate prefabs for north, south, east, and west walls
- **Decoration Prefabs**: Optional decorative elements

### Collectibles & Decorations
- **Collectible Prefabs**: Items the player can pick up
- **Collectible Spawn Chance**: Probability (0-1) of spawning a collectible in each cell
- **Decoration Spawn Chance**: Probability (0-1) of spawning decorations in cells

### Wall Settings
- **Breakable Wall Chance**: Probability (0-1) of a wall being breakable
- **Wall Thickness**: Physical thickness of walls

### Enemy Path Settings
- **Enemy Path Spawn Chance**: Probability (0-1) of generating an enemy path from a cell
- **Debug Draw Paths**: Toggle visibility of enemy paths in the Scene view

### Prefabs
- **Enemy Prefab**: Prefab with EnemyController component
- **Player Prefab**: Your player character prefab
- **Endpoint Prefab**: Object marking the maze exit/win condition

## üß© Prefab Setup Guide

### Wall Prefabs
1. Create simple wall meshes (or use primitive cubes scaled appropriately)
2. Ensure they have:
   - A **Mesh Collider** or **Box Collider** component
   - Appropriate material/texture
   - Consistent orientation (North/South walls should face Z-axis, East/West walls should face X-axis)

### Floor Prefabs
1. Create flat meshes for floor tiles
2. Add a **Mesh Collider** or **Box Collider** component (marked as non-trigger)

### Player & Enemy Prefabs
1. Ensure these have appropriate controllers and colliders
2. For enemies, add the **EnemyController** component

## üîç How It Works

The maze generation uses a depth-first search algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: Creates a grid of cells with walls between all cells
2. **Maze Carving**: Uses depth-first search with backtracking to remove walls and create paths
3. **Element Placement**:
   - Places floors for all cells
   - Adds walls based on the maze data
   - Spawns collectibles randomly
   - Creates enemy paths ensuring they don't overlap with the player spawn
   - Places decorations near walls
   - Positions player at start (SW corner) and endpoint at finish (NE corner)

Special logic ensures:
- Breakable walls are never placed at corners (L-shapes) or T-junctions
- Enemy paths never start at or pass through the player spawn point
- Decorations are positioned along walls without overlapping collectibles

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Tips

### Adding Custom Terrain Themes
1. Create a new set of prefabs (walls, floors, decorations)
2. In the Inspector, increase the size of the TerrainAssets array
3. Assign your new prefabs to the new element

### Modifying Maze Complexity
- Adjust width and height for larger/smaller mazes
- Modify breakable wall chance for more or less destructible environments

### Extending Functionality
- The script can be extended to spawn different types of enemies
- Add power-ups or special collectibles with unique behaviors
- Implement trap mechanisms or moving obstacles

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Walls Appearing Incorrectly**:
   - Ensure wall prefabs are aligned correctly
   - Check that north/south/east/west prefabs are assigned to the correct slots

2. **Enemy Pathing Problems**:
   - Verify EnemyController script is attached to the enemy prefab
   - Check NavMeshAgent component if you're using Unity's navigation system

3. **Performance Issues with Large Mazes**:
   - Consider implementing object pooling for large maze sizes
   - Use LOD (Level of Detail) for complex wall/decoration meshes

### Debug Options

- Enable "Debug Draw Paths" to visualize enemy patrol routes in the Scene view
- Add debug logs in key methods to trace execution flow
